      short_description: Earn BOLT from idle compute
      long_description: |
        Your phone has idle compute. Dispatch puts it to work.

        Open the app, tap Go Live, and your device starts processing
        lightweight AI tasks from the network. You earn BOLT tokens
        on Solana and wBOLT tokens on Monad for every job completed.
        No GPU needed, no setup, no babysitting.

        Two chains, one app:
        - Earn BOLT on Solana Devnet via BoltDistributor
        - Earn wBOLT on Monad Testnet via WrappedBoltDistributor
        - Reputation builds on Monad Testnet via ERC-8004 attestations

        Every result is signed with an ed25519 receipt, so agents know
        the work is real and workers get paid for verified output.

        Works with device key signing (no wallet needed) or connect
        any Solana wallet via Mobile Wallet Adapter for full custody.

        Currently in devnet/beta. The protocol and cryptographic
        signing are production-grade, running against live coordinators.
      new_in_version: Per-job BOLT settlement with visible Solana tx hashes. Updated Monad explorer URLs. Copyable transaction hashes in job detail modal. Fixed stale job selection state.
