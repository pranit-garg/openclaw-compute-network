      short_description: Earn BOLT from idle compute
      long_description: |
        Your phone has idle compute. Dispatch puts it to work.

        Open the app, tap Go Live, and your device starts processing
        lightweight AI tasks from the network. You earn BOLT tokens
        for every job completed. No GPU needed, no setup, no babysitting.

        Two chains, one app:
        - Payments settle on Solana Devnet in BOLT tokens
        - Reputation builds on Monad Testnet via ERC-8004 attestations

        Every result is signed with an ed25519 receipt, so agents know
        the work is real and workers get paid for verified output.

        Works with device key signing (no wallet needed) or connect
        any Solana wallet via Mobile Wallet Adapter for full custody.

        Currently in devnet/beta. The protocol and cryptographic
        signing are production-grade, running against live coordinators.
      new_in_version: New Activity tab shows all jobs and transactions. Cleaner dashboard. Fixed payment display for both Solana and Monad chains.
