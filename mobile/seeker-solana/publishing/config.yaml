    short_description: Turn your idle phone into an AI compute node. Earn SOL.
    long_description: |
      Dispatch turns your phone into an AI compute node. When you're not
      using your device, it picks up lightweight AI tasks from the network
      and earns SOL for every job completed.

      How it works:
      - Connect to the Dispatch coordinator network
      - Your phone receives and processes AI tasks
      - Each completed job is signed with an ed25519 receipt
      - Earn SOL for verified work

      Features:
      - Device key signing — no wallet required, works on any Android device
      - Phantom wallet integration via Mobile Wallet Adapter (optional)
      - Real-time job history and earnings tracking
      - Dark theme optimized for OLED displays
      - x402 micropayment protocol for trustless settlement
      - ERC-8004 onchain reputation building

      Currently in testnet/beta. Earnings are simulated — the protocol
      and cryptographic signing are real.

    App is in testnet/beta mode. Earnings are simulated but the protocol
    and cryptographic signing are real. Connect to the test coordinator
    at the default URL to see jobs arrive.
