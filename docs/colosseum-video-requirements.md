# Colosseum Agent Hackathon: Video Requirements

## Official Requirements (Feb 2-13, 2026)

### Pitch Video (max 3 min)
Must cover:
- Team background and relevant experience
- Problem being solved
- Target audience (who is this for?)
- User feedback/validation (even informal conversations count)
- Broader vision

### Technical Demo (2-3 min, NEW for 2026)
Must cover:
- Core features walkthrough
- Tech stack and design choices
- Solana integration specifics (why Solana, how deep)
- Architecture explanation

**Key rule**: All code must be written by AI agents. This is the Agent Hackathon requirement.

## Judging Criteria

1. **Functionality**: Does it work? Is the demo real?
2. **Business viability**: Is there a real market? Revenue model?
3. **Solana integration quality**: How deeply does it use Solana primitives?
4. **Autonomous agent capabilities**: How agent-native is the architecture?
5. **Post-submission momentum**: Judges look at continued development after deadline

## Prize Structure

| Place | Prize |
|-------|-------|
| 1st | $50,000 |
| 2nd | $30,000 |
| 3rd | $15,000 |
| Most Agentic | $5,000 |
| Solana Mobile Award | $25,000 (best dApp Store submission) |

## Gap Analysis: Dispatch vs. Requirements

### Pitch Video Coverage

| Requirement | Script Section | Status |
|-------------|---------------|--------|
| Team background | 0:20-0:50 BACKGROUND | COVERED |
| Problem being solved | 0:50-1:15 PROBLEM | COVERED |
| Target audience | Not explicitly stated | NEEDS 1 LINE |
| User feedback/validation | Not mentioned | NEEDS 1 LINE |
| Broader vision | 1:55-2:30 TRACTION+VISION | COVERED |
| Agent-native hook | 0:00-0:20 HOOK ("built by AI agents") | COVERED |

### Technical Demo Coverage

| Requirement | Script Section | Status |
|-------------|---------------|--------|
| Core features | Slides 1, 3-5, 7 (system overview, Solana, workers, payment, routing) | COVERED |
| Tech stack + design choices | 0:00-0:15 TITLE + woven through all slides | COVERED |
| Solana integration (why + how deep) | 0:30-0:50 DUAL-CHAIN (why) + 0:50-1:10 SOLANA DEEP DIVE (how deep) | COVERED |
| Architecture explanation | 0:15-0:30 SYSTEM OVERVIEW + 0:30-0:50 DUAL-CHAIN | COVERED |
| Revenue model | 2:00-2:15 TOKENOMICS (5% protocol fee, Jupiter swap, burn) | COVERED |
| Agent-native framing | 0:00-0:15 TITLE (agents can't manage accounts, just HTTP) | COVERED |

### Gaps to Close
1. **Target audience**: Add one line in Problem section: "This is built for the next generation of autonomous AI agents, and for the millions of device owners who want to earn from idle hardware."
2. **User feedback**: Add mention of "dApp Store approved, real Seeker users" in Traction section
3. **Technical Demo is NEW for 2026**: 2-3 min required, must explain Solana integration choices
4. **Post-submission momentum matters**: Judges look at continued development

## Prize Targets

### Primary: 1st Place ($50K)
- Strongest pitch, working MVP, deep Solana integration, agent-native architecture

### Secondary: Solana Mobile Award ($25K)
- Already dApp Store approved with release NFT
- Seeker-first mobile worker deployment
- Mobile Wallet Adapter for authentication

### Tertiary: Most Agentic ($5K)
- Entire codebase built by AI agents (16,000+ lines)
- Agent-native compute marketplace (agents are the customers)
