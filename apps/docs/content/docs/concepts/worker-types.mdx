# Worker Types

OpenClaw has two worker types that serve different roles in the network. The coordinator routes jobs based on each worker's declared capabilities.

## Overview

| Property | Desktop Worker | Seeker Worker |
|----------|---------------|---------------|
| Provider type | `DESKTOP` | `SEEKER` |
| Capabilities | `LLM_INFER`, `TASK` | `TASK` only |
| LLM inference | Yes (via Ollama) | No |
| Task execution | summarize, classify, extract_json | summarize, classify, extract_json |
| Intended device | Servers, desktops | Mobile phones, lightweight devices |
| Key storage | `./data/worker-key.json` | `./data/seeker-key.json` |

## Desktop Worker

The desktop worker is the full-capability node. It handles both LLM inference (through a local Ollama instance) and lightweight TASK jobs.

### Registration

On startup, the desktop worker:

1. Loads or generates an ed25519 keypair
2. Connects to the coordinator via WebSocket
3. Sends a `register` message declaring its capabilities

```typescript
const msg: RegisterMsg = {
  type: "register",
  provider_pubkey: keys.pubkeyHex,
  provider_type: "DESKTOP",
  capabilities: [JobType.LLM_INFER, JobType.TASK],
};
```

4. Waits for a `register_ack` with a `worker_id`
5. Starts sending heartbeats every 10 seconds
6. Optionally claims a trust pairing code if `TRUST_PAIRING_CODE` is set

### Job execution

When the coordinator assigns a job:

- **LLM_INFER**: calls the local Ollama API with the prompt and max_tokens
- **TASK**: runs built-in logic for the specified task_type

After execution, the worker builds a receipt (SHA-256 hash of output, ed25519 signature) and sends `job_complete` with the output and receipt bundled together.

## Seeker Worker

The seeker is a lightweight worker designed for mobile devices. It handles only TASK jobs — no LLM inference.

### Registration

```typescript
const regMsg: RegisterMsg = {
  type: "register",
  provider_pubkey: keys.pubkeyHex,
  provider_type: "SEEKER",
  capabilities: [JobType.TASK],  // TASK only
};
```

### Supported tasks

All seekers can execute these task types:

#### summarize

Truncates input to 200 characters and returns a word count:

```json
{ "summary": "Truncated text...", "word_count": 42 }
```

#### classify

Performs basic sentiment analysis using keyword matching:

```json
{ "sentiment": "positive", "confidence": 0.5 }
```

#### extract_json

Extracts and parses JSON objects from free text:

```json
{ "extracted": [{ "key": "value" }], "count": 1 }
```

## Provider Type Enum

The `ProviderType` enum defines the two worker types:

```typescript
enum ProviderType {
  DESKTOP = "DESKTOP",
  SEEKER  = "SEEKER",
}
```

This is sent in the `register` message and stored by the coordinator to understand each worker's role in the network.

## How the coordinator routes jobs

When a job arrives, the coordinator's `claimWorker()` function finds an available worker that:

1. Has the required capability (e.g., `LLM_INFER` or `TASK`)
2. Is currently online (WebSocket connected, recent heartbeat)
3. Is not busy with another job
4. For PRIVATE jobs: is trust-paired with the submitting user

The coordinator does not prefer desktop over seeker for TASK jobs — any worker with the capability can be assigned.

## Running multiple workers

You can run multiple workers on the same machine by using different key file paths:

```bash
# Worker 1 (default path)
COORDINATOR_URL=http://localhost:4010 pnpm --filter worker-desktop start

# Worker 2 (custom key path)
COORDINATOR_URL=http://localhost:4010 \
WORKER_KEY_PATH=./data/worker-key-2.json \
pnpm --filter worker-desktop start
```

Each worker gets its own ed25519 keypair and registers independently with the coordinator.
