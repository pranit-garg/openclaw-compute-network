# Pricing

Every job in Dispatch has a price denominated in USD, settled in stablecoins (USDC) via x402 micropayments. Prices are determined by the combination of **policy tier** and **job type**.

## Pricing tiers

```typescript
const PRICING_MAP: Record<string, string> = {
  FAST_LLM_INFER: "$0.010",
  FAST_TASK:      "$0.003",
  CHEAP_LLM_INFER: "$0.005",
  CHEAP_TASK:     "$0.001",
};
```

| | LLM_INFER | TASK |
|---|-----------|------|
| **FAST** | $0.010 | $0.003 |
| **CHEAP** | $0.005 | $0.001 |

## Policy

The `Policy` enum controls which pricing tier a job uses:

```typescript
enum Policy {
  FAST  = "FAST",
  CHEAP = "CHEAP",
  AUTO  = "AUTO",
}
```

### AUTO resolution

`AUTO` is the default policy. It resolves based on job type:

- `LLM_INFER` jobs resolve to **FAST** (optimizes for speed)
- `TASK` jobs resolve to **CHEAP** (optimizes for cost)

```typescript
function resolvePolicy(policy: Policy, jobType: JobType): Policy.FAST | Policy.CHEAP {
  if (policy !== Policy.AUTO) return policy;
  return jobType === JobType.LLM_INFER ? Policy.FAST : Policy.CHEAP;
}
```

## How pricing works in practice

### 1. Get a quote

Before committing a job, get a quote to see the price and which endpoint to use:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:4010/v1/quote?job_type=LLM_INFER&policy=AUTO"
```

```json
{
  "price": "$0.010",
  "endpoint": "/v1/jobs/commit/fast",
  "policy_resolved": "FAST",
  "network": "eip155:10143",
  "expires_at": null
}
```

The `endpoint` field tells you which commit URL to use. This matches the resolved policy tier.

### 2. Pay via x402

When x402 payment gating is enabled, the commit endpoint returns `402 Payment Required` on the first request. The response includes payment details:

```json
{
  "error": "X-PAYMENT header is required",
  "accepts": [
    {
      "scheme": "exact",
      "price": "$0.010",
      "network": "eip155:10143",
      "payTo": "0x...",
      "asset": "0x534b..."
    }
  ]
}
```

The SDK handles this automatically. It signs a stablecoin payment and retries with the `X-PAYMENT` header.

### 3. Testnet mode

In testnet mode (`TESTNET_MODE=true`), x402 payment gating is off. Jobs submit without any payment. Use this for development and testing.

## Price calculation

The `getPrice()` function looks up the price from the pricing map:

```typescript
function getPrice(policy: Policy.FAST | Policy.CHEAP, jobType: JobType): string {
  const key = `${policy}_${jobType}`;
  return PRICING_MAP[key] ?? "$0.001";
}
```

The key is constructed as `{POLICY}_{JOB_TYPE}`, e.g., `FAST_LLM_INFER` or `CHEAP_TASK`.

## x402 payment configuration

The coordinator builds x402 payment configs for each endpoint:

- `POST /v1/jobs/commit/fast`: priced at FAST tier
- `POST /v1/jobs/commit/cheap`: priced at CHEAP tier

Payment is settled in USDC on the configured chain (Monad or Solana). See [x402 Payments](/docs/concepts/x402-payments) for the full protocol details.

## Staking Tier Effects

BOLT staking tiers affect which job tiers a worker can access:

| Worker Stake Tier | CHEAP Jobs | FAST Jobs | PRIVATE Jobs |
|------------------|------------|-----------|--------------|
| Open (0 BOLT) | ✓ | - | With trust pairing |
| Verified (100 BOLT) | ✓ | ✓ | With trust pairing |
| Sentinel (1,000 BOLT) | ✓ | ✓ | With trust pairing |

Open-tier workers only receive CHEAP tier jobs (tasks like summarization, classification, extraction). Verified and Sentinel workers can receive both CHEAP and FAST tier jobs, including LLM inference.

Private jobs require trust pairing regardless of stake tier. Staking doesn't bypass the privacy model.

Sentinels also receive a share of protocol revenue from the 5% BOLT fee collected on every job (planned).
