# BOLT Token (Upcoming)

**USDC today. BOLT tomorrow.**

> **Current status:** Workers earn USDC per job via x402 micropayments. BOLT is designed but not yet deployed. The information below describes the planned token economics.

BOLT is the planned settlement layer of the Dispatch compute network. Today, agents pay USDC via x402 and workers earn USDC directly. When BOLT launches, every USDC payment will auto-convert to BOLT before reaching the worker.

## BOLT-as-Settlement Model (Planned)

The key insight: instead of skimming a percentage fee, **100% of economic activity flows through BOLT**. If the network processes $1M in compute, $1M of buy pressure hits the BOLT token, not $50K.

Currently, workers earn USDC directly for every completed job.

### Flow

When BOLT launches, the flow will be:

1. **Agent pays USDC.** Standard x402 payment header, same as always.
2. **Coordinator receives USDC.** x402 facilitator verifies payment.
3. **Auto-swap via Jupiter.** USDC converts to BOLT on Jupiter DEX (atomic, in the job commit flow).
4. **Protocol fee.** 5% of BOLT permanently burned.
5. **Worker receives BOLT.** Remaining 95% deposited to worker's wallet.

Workers choose what to do with earned BOLT:
- **Hold.** Price upside as network usage grows.
- **Stake.** Lock BOLT for priority matching and reputation multiplier.
- **Sell.** Swap back to USDC on Jupiter anytime.

## Value Accrual Flywheel (Planned)

Three sources of pressure work together:

1. **Buy pressure.** Every job creates a USDC-to-BOLT swap on Jupiter. More jobs = more buying.
2. **Supply lock.** Workers stake BOLT for better matching priority. Staked BOLT is locked, reducing circulating supply.
3. **Burn.** 5% protocol fee is permanently burned on every job. Total supply decreases over time.

Result: More jobs, more buying, less supply, price appreciation, workers earn more value per job, more workers, more capacity, more jobs.

## Staking Tiers

> Staking activates when BOLT launches on Solana.

Staking is optional. Any worker can earn with zero stake, preserving the "100x lower barrier to entry" philosophy. Staking unlocks priority matching and reputation multipliers.

| Tier | Required Stake | Job Access | Priority Bonus | Rep Multiplier | Additional |
|------|---------------|------------|----------------|----------------|------------|
| **Open** | 0 BOLT | CHEAP tier only | +0 | 1.0x | - |
| **Verified** | 100 BOLT | All tiers | +5 | 1.5x | - |
| **Sentinel** | 1,000 BOLT | All tiers | +10 | 2.0x | Protocol revenue share (via treasury distribution, planned) |

Priority bonus adds directly to the worker's matching score. Reputation multiplier amplifies the ERC-8004 score contribution to matching.

## Token Distribution

Fixed supply of 1 billion BOLT. No inflation mechanism.

| Category | Allocation | Vesting |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Worker Rewards | 40% | 4-year emission, halving annually |
| Team + Advisors | 15% | 1-year cliff, 3-year linear vest |
| Treasury / DAO | 15% | Community governed, 6-month timelock |
| Community / Airdrops | 10% | Early adopter incentives |
| Liquidity | 10% | DEX pools, 1-year lock |
| Hackathon Reserve | 5% | Testnet faucet and grants |
| Strategic Partners | 5% | x402, Solana, ERC-8004 ecosystem |

## Cross-Chain Design

- **Solana.** BOLT is a native SPL token. Workers earn, stake, and trade where they already have wallets. Deeper consumer DeFi via Jupiter and Raydium.
- **Monad.** Wrapped BOLT (ERC-20) for governance. Protocol proposals and voting happen on Monad alongside the ERC-8004 reputation system.
- Both coordinators read Solana stake levels to determine worker tier.

## Jupiter DEX Integration

BOLT will trade on Jupiter with real liquidity (planned). The swap happens atomically in the job commit flow:

1. x402 verifies USDC payment
2. Coordinator calls Jupiter Quote API (`GET /v6/quote`)
3. Builds swap transaction (USDC input, BOLT output, 0.5% slippage)
4. Signs and submits as part of the job commit

On Solana devnet: BOLT SPL token deployed with seeded liquidity pool.
On mainnet: BOLT trades with organic liquidity.
