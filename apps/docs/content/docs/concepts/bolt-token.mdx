# BOLT Token

**Workers earn BOLT on every job, on both chains.**

> **Current status:** BOLT (SPL) is live on Solana devnet. wBOLT (ERC-20) is live on Monad testnet. Jupiter auto-swap is built with fallback to direct distribution until a BOLT/USDC pool is created.

BOLT is the settlement layer of the Dispatch compute network. Agents pay USDC via x402 micropayments. The coordinator auto-swaps USDC to BOLT via Jupiter DEX (when a pool exists) or distributes BOLT directly from the authority. Workers earn BOLT on Solana and wBOLT on Monad.

## BOLT-as-Settlement Model

The key insight: instead of skimming a percentage fee, **100% of economic activity flows through BOLT**. If the network processes $1M in compute, $1M of buy pressure hits the BOLT token, not $50K.

### Flow

1. **Agent pays USDC.** Standard x402 payment header, same as always.
2. **Coordinator receives USDC.** x402 facilitator verifies payment.
3. **Auto-swap via Jupiter.** USDC converts to BOLT on Jupiter DEX (with fallback to direct authority distribution).
4. **Protocol fee.** 5% of BOLT collected by treasury.
5. **Worker receives BOLT.** Remaining 95% deposited to worker via batched settlement.

Workers choose what to do with earned BOLT:
- **Hold.** Price upside as network usage grows.
- **Stake.** Lock BOLT for priority matching and reputation multiplier.
- **Sell.** Swap back to USDC on Jupiter anytime.

## Value Accrual Flywheel

Three sources of pressure work together:

1. **Buy pressure.** Every job creates a USDC-to-BOLT swap on Jupiter. More jobs = more buying.
2. **Supply lock.** Workers stake BOLT for better matching priority. Staked BOLT is locked, reducing circulating supply.
3. **Protocol fee.** 5% collected per job, funding the treasury for buybacks and ecosystem grants.

Result: More jobs, more buying, less supply, price appreciation, workers earn more value per job, more workers, more capacity, more jobs.

## Staking Tiers

> Staking reads BOLT balance for tier assignment. Dedicated lockup program is planned.

Staking is optional. Any worker can earn with zero stake, preserving the "100x lower barrier to entry" philosophy. Staking unlocks priority matching and reputation multipliers.

| Tier | Required Stake | Job Access | Priority Bonus | Rep Multiplier | Additional |
|------|---------------|------------|----------------|----------------|------------|
| **Open** | 0 BOLT | CHEAP tier only | +0 | 1.0x | - |
| **Verified** | 100 BOLT | All tiers | +5 | 1.5x | - |
| **Sentinel** | 1,000 BOLT | All tiers | +10 | 2.0x | Protocol revenue share (via treasury distribution, planned) |

Priority bonus adds directly to the worker's matching score. Reputation multiplier amplifies the ERC-8004 score contribution to matching.

## Token Distribution

Fixed supply of 1 billion BOLT. No inflation mechanism.

| Category | Allocation | Vesting |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Worker Rewards | 40% | 4-year emission, halving annually |
| Team + Advisors | 15% | 1-year cliff, 3-year linear vest |
| Treasury / DAO | 15% | Community governed, 6-month timelock |
| Community / Airdrops | 10% | Early adopter incentives |
| Liquidity | 10% | DEX pools, 1-year lock |
| Hackathon Reserve | 5% | Testnet faucet and grants |
| Strategic Partners | 5% | x402, Solana, ERC-8004 ecosystem |

## Cross-Chain Design

- **Solana.** BOLT is a native SPL token. Workers earn, stake, and trade where they already have wallets. Deeper consumer DeFi via Jupiter and Raydium.
- **Monad.** Wrapped BOLT (wBOLT, ERC-20) live on testnet. Workers earn wBOLT per job via WrappedBoltDistributor. Protocol proposals and voting planned for Monad alongside the ERC-8004 reputation system.
- Both coordinators read Solana stake levels to determine worker tier.

## Jupiter DEX Integration

The coordinator auto-swaps USDC to BOLT via Jupiter. When no pool exists, it falls back to direct authority distribution.

1. x402 verifies USDC payment
2. Coordinator calls Jupiter Quote API (`GET /v6/quote`)
3. POST to Jupiter Swap API for serialized transaction
4. Sign and submit the swap (USDC input, BOLT output, 0.5% slippage)
5. On failure: fall back to direct BOLT distribution from authority

BOLT/USDC liquidity pool creation is the next step to activate Jupiter routing on devnet.
