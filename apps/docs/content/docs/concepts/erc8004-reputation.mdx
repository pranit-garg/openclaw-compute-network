# ERC-8004 Reputation

Every Dispatch worker gets a verifiable, portable identity and reputation score onchain through [ERC-8004](https://github.com/erc-8004/erc-8004-contracts). Reputation lives on Monad regardless of which chain the job settles on. Workers take their track record anywhere. None of it is locked to Dispatch.

## What is ERC-8004

ERC-8004 is a standard for agent identity and reputation onchain. It defines two registries:

### Identity Registry

Contract: `0x8004A818...` (Monad testnet)

Agents register as ERC-721 NFTs. Each token has a URI pointing to metadata (name, description, capabilities). Every worker gets a persistent, ownable identity that any protocol can read.

### Reputation Registry

Contract: `0x8004B663...` (Monad testnet)

Tracks feedback entries with aggregated scores. Each entry includes a numeric score, tags, and the feedback provider's address. Scores are filterable by tag, so consumers can query reputation for specific job types.

## How Dispatch uses it

### Agent registration

Workers register as ERC-8004 agents via an onchain transaction. The `registerAgent()` function mints an ERC-721 identity NFT and returns the assigned `agentId` from the contract event. Registration is a one-time operation per worker.

### Feedback posting

After a job completes, the coordinator posts feedback to the Reputation Registry with a configurable score (0-100). Typical values: 80 for success, 20 for failure. The `buildJobFeedback()` helper constructs the feedback entry from job completion data.

Feedback posts automatically as part of the job completion flow.

### Score retrieval

The coordinator reads worker reputations from the Reputation Registry on-the-fly. The raw `summaryValue` is returned from the contract. Higher reputation means priority assignment when the coordinator selects workers for jobs.

### Cross-chain reputation

Reputation always lives on Monad, even when a job settles on Solana. The Solana coordinator posts feedback back to Monad after job completion. One reputation, one chain, regardless of where the work runs.

### Optional activation

ERC-8004 kicks in when the `ERC8004_PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable is set. Without it, the coordinator runs without reputation tracking.

```bash
ERC8004_PRIVATE_KEY=0xabc123... pnpm --filter coordinator-monad start
```

## API functions

The `@dispatch/erc8004` package exposes:

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `registerAgent()` | Register a new agent identity as an ERC-721 NFT |
| `getReputationSummary(agentId)` | Get aggregated reputation summary for an agent |
| `giveFeedback(entry, account)` | Post a feedback entry to the Reputation Registry |
| `getFeedbackClients(agentId)` | List addresses that have submitted feedback for an agent |
| `readFeedback(agentId, clientAddress, feedbackIndex)` | Read a specific feedback entry |
| `buildJobFeedback()` | Build a feedback entry from job completion data |
| `getAgentInfo(agentId)` | Get agent metadata (owner, URI) |
| `buildFeedbackHash(...)` | Build a keccak256 hash for feedback verification |

## Why it matters

Most compute marketplaces lock worker reputation inside their own platform. ERC-8004 makes reputation portable and verifiable:

- **Workers own their reputation.** An onchain asset, not a platform metric.
- **Any protocol can read it.** Not just Dispatch; any service can check a worker's track record.
- **Trustless verification.** The data is onchain, no need to trust Dispatch's word.
- **Sybil resistance.** Reputation accumulates over real work, making it expensive to fake.

Good workers get rewarded across every protocol that reads ERC-8004, not just Dispatch.

## Stake-Based Reputation Multiplier

BOLT staking amplifies ERC-8004 reputation scores in the matching algorithm:

| Stake Tier | BOLT Required | Rep Multiplier | Priority Bonus |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|----------------|
| Open | 0 | 1.0x | +0 |
| Verified | 100 | 1.5x | +5 |
| Sentinel | 1,000 | 2.0x | +10 |

A Sentinel-tier worker with 80/100 ERC-8004 reputation contributes `(80/100) × 10 × 2.0 = 16` to their matching score, compared to `(80/100) × 10 × 1.0 = 8` for an Open-tier worker with the same reputation.

Staking is optional. Workers earn BOLT with zero stake. But staking creates a positive feedback loop: higher tier, better jobs, more BOLT earned, more staking.
