# Dual-Chain Architecture

Dispatch runs on two chains, not because "we support two chains" sounds good, but because each chain does something the other can't.

## The Practical Split

### Solana: The Economic Layer

Solana handles money and mobile devices:

- **BOLT token.** Native SPL token. Workers earn, stake, and trade BOLT on Solana.
- **USDC payments.** x402 settlement via `ExactSvmScheme` on Solana devnet.
- **Seeker devices.** Phones with Solana wallets (Phantom via MWA). These are the supply-side workers.
- **Staking.** BOLT staking program for tier-based matching priority.
- **DeFi.** Jupiter, Raydium, Phantom, giving workers immediate liquidity and trading.
- **Cost.** Sub-cent transaction fees make frequent stake/unstake operations practical.

### Monad: The Trust Layer

Monad handles identity and governance:

- **ERC-8004 reputation.** The ERC-8004 standard is EVM-only Solidity. It can't run on Solana. Workers register as agents and build verifiable, onchain track records.
- **Governance.** Wrapped BOLT (ERC-20) on Monad for protocol proposals and voting.
- **Receipt anchoring.** Job receipt hashes anchored onchain for permanent, verifiable proof.
- **Smart contract programmability.** Monad's EVM compatibility enables complex reputation logic (validation registries, slashing conditions, cross-protocol composability).

## Why Not Just One Chain?

You can't run ERC-8004 on Solana. It's EVM-only Solidity with a specific contract interface (`IIdentityRegistry`, `IReputationRegistry`). Porting it would mean forking the standard, losing compatibility with the broader ERC-8004 ecosystem.

You can't reach Seeker devices on Monad. They have Solana wallets, use Phantom, and interact via Mobile Wallet Adapter. Asking mobile workers to bridge to an EVM chain adds friction that kills adoption.

## How It Works In Practice

Both coordinators are independent:
- **Monad coordinator** (port 4010): EVM x402 settlement, ERC-8004 reputation, reads BOLT stake cross-chain from Solana
- **Solana coordinator** (port 4020): SVM x402 settlement, BOLT staking natively, reads BOLT stake directly

Each has its own SQLite database, worker pool, and x402 payment configuration. A worker can connect to both simultaneously.

### Cross-Chain Reads

The Monad coordinator reads BOLT stake levels from Solana:
- Queries Solana RPC for the worker's BOLT token balance
- Maps balance to stake tier (Open / Verified / Sentinel)
- Uses tier for matching priority, same as the Solana coordinator

This is a read-only cross-chain operation. No bridge, no wrapped tokens for staking.
