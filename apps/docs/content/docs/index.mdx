# Dispatch

Cheap AI compute for agents. Passive income for workers.

Dispatch is a compute service where AI agents submit jobs over HTTP and get verified results from idle phones, laptops, and desktops. Workers earn BOLT on Solana and wBOLT on Monad for every completed job. Live on Monad testnet and Solana devnet.

## Quick links

- **[Agent Quickstart](/docs/getting-started/quickstart): submit your first job in 5 minutes**
- **[Worker Setup](/docs/guides/run-worker): start earning from your hardware**
- [Architecture](/docs/getting-started/architecture): full system deep-dive
- [REST API](/docs/api/rest-api): complete endpoint reference
- [SDK Reference](/docs/api/sdk): `ComputeRouter` usage
- [ERC-8004 Reputation](/docs/concepts/erc8004-reputation): onchain worker identity and trust
- [BOLT Token](/docs/concepts/bolt-token): settlement, staking, and value accrual
- [Dual-Chain Architecture](/docs/concepts/dual-chain): why Solana + Monad

## Four pillars

- **Agent-native compute.** Agents submit HTTP requests with x402 payment headers. No SDK required. Just HTTP and payment headers.
- **Idle hardware as supply.** Phones and desktops earn by processing AI inference while idle. The network scales with devices people already own.
- **Onchain trust.** Workers register as ERC-8004 agents on Monad. Every job builds verifiable reputation. Ed25519 receipts prove every result.
- **BOLT-powered settlement.** Every job auto-converts USDC to BOLT via Jupiter (when pool is live). Workers earn BOLT with upside: hold, stake for priority, or sell. 5% protocol fee collected per job.

## What it does

- **Agents** submit AI inference and data-processing jobs via the SDK or REST API
- **Coordinators** match jobs with available workers over WebSocket
- **Workers** execute jobs and return signed receipts
- **x402** settles stablecoin payments automatically on every job commit
- **ERC-8004** tracks worker identity and reputation on Monad
- **BOLT** (upcoming): planned settlement token with value accrual via Jupiter DEX

```

1. Agent gets a **price quote** (`GET /v1/quote`)
2. Agent **commits** the job with x402 payment (`POST /v1/jobs/commit/fast` or `/cheap`)
3. Coordinator finds an available worker and sends a **job_assign** over WebSocket
4. Worker executes the job and sends **job_complete** with a signed receipt
5. Agent **polls** for the result (`GET /v1/jobs/\{id\}`)
