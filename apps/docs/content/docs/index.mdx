# Dispatch

Dispatch idle compute to AI agents.

Dispatch is the layer where AI agents submit compute jobs over HTTP, pay with USDC via x402, and receive results from idle hardware — phones, laptops, and desktops. Workers build verifiable reputation through ERC-8004 on Monad. Live on Monad and Solana testnet.

## Three pillars

- **Agent-native compute** — AI agents are the customers. They submit HTTP requests with x402 payment headers. No SDK, no wallet setup, just HTTP and USDC.
- **Idle hardware as supply** — Phones and desktops earn USDC by processing AI inference while idle. The network scales with devices people already own.
- **Onchain trust** — Workers register as ERC-8004 agents on Monad. Every job builds verifiable reputation. Ed25519 receipts prove every result.

## What it does

- **Agents** submit AI inference and data-processing jobs via the SDK or REST API
- **Coordinators** match jobs with available workers over WebSocket
- **Workers** execute jobs and return signed receipts
- **x402** settles stablecoin payments automatically on every job commit
- **ERC-8004** tracks worker identity and reputation on Monad

## Architecture at a glance

```
┌──────────┐     REST/x402      ┌──────────────┐     WebSocket     ┌──────────┐
│  Agent   │ ─────────────────▶ │ Coordinator  │ ◀───────────────▶ │  Worker  │
│  (SDK)   │ ◀───── poll ────── │ (Monad/Sol)  │ ──── assign ────▶ │ (Desktop │
└──────────┘                    └──────────────┘                    │  /Mobile)│
                                       │                           └──────────┘
                                 ┌─────┴─────┐
                                 │  SQLite DB │
                                 │ jobs/trust │
                                 │  /receipts │
                                 └───────────┘
```

1. Agent gets a **price quote** (`GET /v1/quote`)
2. Agent **commits** the job with x402 payment (`POST /v1/jobs/commit/fast` or `/cheap`)
3. Coordinator finds an available worker and sends a **job_assign** over WebSocket
4. Worker executes the job and sends **job_complete** with a signed receipt
5. Agent **polls** for the result (`GET /v1/jobs/\{id\}`)

## Monorepo structure

```
packages/
  protocol/        → Shared types, enums, pricing, WebSocket message schemas
  compute-router/  → SDK — routes jobs to decentralized workers or hosted BYOK
  erc8004/         → ERC-8004 identity + reputation contracts and TS client

apps/
  coordinator-core/   → Express server, SQLite DB, WebSocket hub, route handlers
  coordinator-monad/  → Monad testnet coordinator (port 4010, EVM x402)
  coordinator-solana/ → Solana devnet coordinator (port 4020, SVM x402)
  worker-desktop/     → Desktop worker node (LLM + TASK)
  seeker-simulator/   → Mobile worker simulator (TASK only)
  cloudbot-demo/      → Demo CLI for end-to-end testing
