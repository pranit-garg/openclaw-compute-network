# OpenClaw Compute Network

Decentralized compute that pays workers per job over HTTP 402.

OpenClaw connects AI workloads to a distributed network of workers — desktops, servers, and mobile devices — and settles every job with x402 micropayments on Monad and Solana.

## What it does

- **Seekers** submit AI inference and data-processing jobs via the SDK or REST API
- **Coordinators** match jobs with available workers over WebSocket
- **Workers** execute jobs and return signed receipts
- **x402** settles stablecoin payments automatically on every job commit

## Key features

- **x402-native payments** — every job is a stablecoin micropayment via Coinbase's HTTP 402 protocol. No custom token, no staking.
- **Mobile-first supply** — seekers turn phones into compute nodes for lightweight tasks (summarize, classify, extract JSON).
- **Privacy by architecture** — trust pairing routes private jobs exclusively to workers you control, enforced at the coordinator level.
- **Dual-chain** — Monad (EVM) and Solana run as parallel coordinators with separate databases from day one.
- **Cryptographic receipts** — workers sign ed25519 receipts over output hashes, designed for on-chain anchoring.

                                       │                           └──────────┘
                                 ┌─────┴─────┐
                                 │  SQLite DB │
                                 │ jobs/trust │
                                 │  /receipts │
                                 └───────────┘
```

1. Seeker gets a **price quote** (`GET /v1/quote`)
2. Seeker **commits** the job with x402 payment (`POST /v1/jobs/commit/fast` or `/cheap`)
3. Coordinator finds an available worker and sends a **job_assign** over WebSocket
4. Worker executes the job and sends **job_complete** with a signed receipt
5. Seeker **polls** for the result (`GET /v1/jobs/\{id\}`)

## Monorepo structure

```
packages/
  protocol/        → Shared types, enums, pricing, WebSocket message schemas
  compute-router/  → SDK — routes jobs to decentralized workers or hosted BYOK

apps/
  coordinator-core/   → Express server, SQLite DB, WebSocket hub, route handlers
  coordinator-monad/  → Monad testnet coordinator (port 4010, EVM x402)
  coordinator-solana/ → Solana devnet coordinator (port 4020, SVM x402)
  worker-desktop/     → Desktop worker node (LLM + TASK)
  seeker-simulator/   → Mobile seeker simulator (TASK only)
  cloudbot-demo/      → Demo CLI for end-to-end testing
```
